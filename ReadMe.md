Blueberry Waffle  
I Could Have Won  
> I believe I have solved this problem correctly, however, I also believe Sample Output 1 on the webpage is incorrect. The input is BBAAABABBAAABB. The suggested output for all values of k is "3 6 7". When running my code that output Sample Output 2 correctly with Sample Input 1, the output for all values was "3 4 6 7". Upon going through Sample Input 1, I discovered that 4 is a value of k that would lead to Alice winning. The final score in a first-to-4 round with the scores would be BBAAABA with Bob having 3 points and Alice having 4.
